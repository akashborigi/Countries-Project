Our investigative analysis within Tableau has offered a panoramic view of the factors influencing global development. We've uncovered a positive correlation between economic development and literacy, signaling the transformative power of education. The shift from agricultural reliance to service-oriented economies marks a transition in economic maturity. Health metrics and net migration painted a more complex picture, suggesting multifaceted influences beyond mere economics. The interplay between climate and agriculture, as well as technology's reflection of economic health, were particularly telling. This report not only sheds light on the state of global development but also sets the stage for future policy and research to foster growth and improve health outcomes worldwide. With interactive Tableau visualizations, we've provided a canvas for readers to draw their insights, ensuring that our findings resonate with a diverse audience and inspire action.
